                <p class="textslidertrans1"><strong>Starting your journey from the airport</strong><br>The quickest route from the airport to Copenhagen is via regional train or Metro. It takes under 15 minutes to reach the city centre and you can buy the tickets you need at the airport: you need a 3-zone ticket that
                    costs approximately DKK 36. The train runs directly to Copennhagen Central Station (Hovedbanegård) in the centre of the city and is ideal if you are staying there or want to take a train onwards to other Danish cities. 
                    If you want to reach Nørrebro, Vesterbro, Frederiksberg, Osterbrø or other areas of Copenhagen, the metro is the best option. You can also take bus 5A from the airport to reach the city centre in approximately 35 minutes,
                     and there is a taxi rank outside Arrivals. Typically, taxis cost DKK 250-350 and take 20-30 minutes to reach the city centre.</p>

   <p class="introductionslider">Getting Around Denmark:</p>

               are a cheap way to get around Denmark and are offered throughout most of Denmark. Expect to pay around 20-25 Krones for a bus ticket, which is valid for one hour. In major cities like Copenhagen, 
                   buses run every ten minutes during peak business hours. By far, the best way to visit rural Denmark is by car, but if you want or need to travel by bus, be aware that you'll probably get your bus at the railway station.  
                   Several different companies are operating, but not all of them have English-languages websites, so it’s a good idea to contact the tourist office of the destination you have in mind, to ask for their guidance on routes and tickets.
                    There is one big international operator, <a href="https://global.flixbus.com/" target="_blank">Flixbus</a> , which has good and cheap connections across Denmark. </p>

               The train system in Denmark is well connected, and most trains do not require booking in advance. Ticket prices depending on how far you’re going.A train from Copenhagen to Aarhus will take three hours,
                    to Aalborg four hours and to Odense an hour and a half. DSB is the official Danish national rail operator, and you can see train routes, find times and book train tickets on the DSB website or by calling 
                    +45 70 13 14 15. Booking in advance, up to two months before travel, is advised – check the section ‘DSB Orange’ for the best value off peak tickets on the train operator’s website. A word you're likely to see 
                    and hear frequently is <a href="https://rail.ninja/train/lyntog" target="_blank">Lyntog</a> ("Express Trains"), which are the fastest trains presently operational in Denmark. Be warned in advance that the most crowded times on Danish trains are Fridays, Sundays, and national holidays,

               <p class="textslidertrans1">It is easy to rent a car in Denmark, and you will find many of the international car rental companies in the country.  Renting a car is an alternative way to get around Denmark. You can rent a car if you are at least 21 years old and have had your driver’s license for at least 1 year. 
                Prices start at around 460 Krones per day. <a href="https://www.avis.com/en/home">Avis</a> ,<a href="https://www.budget.com/en/home">Budget </a> , and <a href="https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/reservation/"> Hertz</a> offer well-serviced, well-maintained fleets of cars. You may have to reserve and pay for your 
                rental car in advance (usually 2 weeks, but occasionally as little as 48 hr.) to get the lowest rates. Agencies that encourage prepaid rates almost never collect this tax in advance -- instead, it's 
                imposed as part of a separate transaction when you pick up the car. Furthermore, any car retrieved at a Danish airport is subject to a one-time <strong>supplemental tax of DKK255 (RM153)</strong> , so you might prefer to pick up your car at a downtown location. <br> </p>

            As you'd expect from a country made up of so many islands, boats and ferries provide an essential service. It's also a refreshing way to travel. In Danish ferries are called færger or bilfærger.It is often cheaper and quicker to take ferries in Denmark than to pay bridge tolls and petrol costs.
                When booking a reservation on any of the ferries in Denmark, it is always best to use the website versus calling them.
                Please remember to check the map of denmark to find out where the ferries in Denmark are traveling from and to. There are many ferry routes that you can choose from. The Mellerup/Voer Ferry is the oldest ferry in Denmark and it is an actual cable ferry. You are pulled across by a cable.
